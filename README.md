# Signed-MNIST-recognition
I developed a convolutional neural network model for recognising letters from the  [Sign Language MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist/ "Named link title"), consisting of 24 letters in sign language (excluding those that require motion). This CNN uses 4 convolutional layers, 3 pooling layers, and 1 fully connected layer to accurately classify the input images as the relevant letter. 

Libraries implemented within this project:
* Keras
* TensorFlow
* Numpy
